<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">
*King Merriweather* is a concept album by the San Francisco-based [The Definite Articles](https://thedefinitearticles.bandcamp.com/). Band leader [Shawn Alpay](http://shawnalpay.com/) wanted a thematic set for the release of the album and arranged for the show to be held in a 1920s arts and crafts style church on Ocean Avenue designed by Julia Morgan.

While working in a church designed by Julia Morgan was a tremendous opportunity, it also provided some challenging constraints. First, because the church has an active congregation and the shows were on weekend nights, we had one day for setup, one day for teardown. Second, we had to build safe, secure, large-scale elements without putting holes in or otherwise marring the building.

Dina Dobkin lead the design which featured a back-lit radial sun pattern framed by edge-lit mountains which inverted at the stage boundary.

Additional fabrication assistance was provided by Ron Baker. Framing work by Brian Turner.
