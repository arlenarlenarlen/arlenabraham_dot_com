This is a permanent installation by Nikolas Weinstein Studios in the lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel, Puxi, Shanghai. The installation is comprised of eleven sculptural elements composed of thousands of individual glass tubes woven into fabric panels.

I was charged with developing a physical modeling material using castable shape memory polymer, developing a CAD model of the piece from Nikolasâ€™ 1:40 physical model, and then programming custom analytical geometry software to determine the lengths, locations, and attachment points of nearly 1000 suspension cables. This also included the creation of a workflow and nomenclature to enabling a team of 10 workers to work efficiently in sculpting the fabric. Lived in Shanghai for one month during the installation.
