<div class="wrapper" markdown="1">
The Orion management console, or Atlas, was designed by Toni Chen, a UX designer at Orion Labs who was on the design team I lead. The web console is the core interaction for Orion Pro customers. It allows team administrators to manage users, groups, apps and devices from the web. I met with Toni frequently as she built this app from the ground up to provide feedback and guidance. In addition to the information architecture challenges presented by building this web console, we also had to build a tool that felt like it was part of the Orion brand family, but sufficiently differentiated from the app or marketing website to provide context. Moreover an MVP, it was important to provide room to grow and build a scaffold upon which we could build future functionality.
