The mobile app is the primary way that customers interact with Orion, whether it's using it to talk to people directly using AppTalk, or using Onyx as a smart walkie-talkie. The the design for the Orion iOS and Android apps were created by Elise Lawley, a UX designer at Orion Labs that was on the design team I led. Elise redesigned the Orion app from the ground up, taking our generic MVP app and not only bringing it in line with our new brand, but also making both the iOS and Android versions feel more native. I consulted with Elise frequently during the redesign process, providing feedback, big picture context, and guidance. One of the challenges in this redesign is that we weren't allowed to change any of the underlying functionality of the app. Another was creating space for future features, such as AppTalk.
