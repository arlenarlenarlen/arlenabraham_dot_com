Tympani Lambada is a Burning Man Honorarium project 2011 by the Flaming Lotus Girls. The sculpture is comprised of two major trussed arches, a third cantilevered arch, sound-reactive benches and a spiral shaped methanol fountain with drip and shooter effects. The two large arches feature RS-485 controlled propane flame effects with fan-shaped diffusers capable of creating massive sheets of fire or sequenced bursts. The inner, cantilevered arch features spherical LED pixels providing ambient lighting. The inner arch also features sequenced, computer-controlled “hammers” that sound against the structural steel of the sculpture. Lastly, the sculpture includes a propane/forced air effect which uses six 14A independently speed-controlled motors, fuel controls, and chemical powder injectors to creates rapid percussive noises, extreme temperatures, and bursts of colored flame.

Rather than build a single-purpose breaker box, I designed a scalable power distribution system for this sculpture that would serve the Flaming Lotus girls for years to come. The distro is completely contained within a road case and takes 200A of 3-phase camlock power and safely powers: 6 30A ignitor circuits, 12 edison duplex circuits, 3 “spider boxes”, and also has camlok passthroughs. For Tympani, this box powered LEDs, acoustic hammers, hot surface ignitors, solenoids, forced air effect blowers, fountain solenoids, bench lighting.

Additionally, I was charged with creating the LED light and acoustic hammer control boxes including, power supplies, RS-485 communication network, passive cooling, data and power connectors for multiple systems, and custom laser-cut face plates.
