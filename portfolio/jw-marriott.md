This is a permanent installation by [Nikolas Weinstein Studios](https://nikolas.net/) in the Great Room of the JW Marriott Hotel in Aerocity, New Delhi. It is composed of eight discrete elements suspended from the ceiling. Each element is made of pleated glass “fabric” which is woven together with fine, stainless-steel, aircraft cable.

I was the project manager for this installation for over a year, including specification and design of the glass tubing, overseeing production of the glass at the factory in China, digital modeling including using Grasshopper to generate suspension hardware data, production of the sculpture in San Francisco with up to 14 workers, and finally planning and executing the installation with a team of ten.
