Orion's website, OrionLabs.io, was designed by Toni Chen, a UX designer at Orion Labs that was on the design team I led. The website is one of the primary expressions of the Orion Brand, which was one of my primary responsibilities at Orion. The site is designed to help sell Orion Lab's core offering, Orion Pro, which allows teams to full access to Orion including unlimited group sizes, unlimited number of groups, app integrations, and a web-based management console. I met with Toni frequently during the development of the Orion website to provide feedback, guidance, and refine the Orion brand. One of the primary challenges we had was creating a selling tool that was of the same brand family as the mobile app and web console, but also sufficiently differentiated to provide context to the customer. The site makes heavy use of large blocks of color, as well as mono-weight glyphs to help convey a professional, service-oriented affect.
